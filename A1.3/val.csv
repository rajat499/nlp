Hi Sudhir

As you  are aware, we are organizing Tech2Impact on July 24-26th. The
main goal of the program is to bring together people with diverse skills
such as technologists (ex:  researchers and inventors) that have
technology and entrepreneurs from engineering, design, business and
management background to form teams and work towards commercializing
high-end technology.

Interested participants can enroll through the website at
http://tech2impact.iitgn.ac.in <http://tech2impact.iitgn.ac.in/> where
they can interact with other participants and form teams. The website
was originally supposed to accept new participants till 30^th  of June.
However we are extending it till July 5th to enable better response.

Key target for this are researchers who have invented new technology and
are interested in commercializing it.  Could you kindly put in a word to
help us get participation from IIT faculty and researchers ? Attached is
a flyer related to the event.

Best regards
Hiran

Thank you very much for your overwhelming support! We had 102 =
submissions which is about 88.6% compliance :-) in a day's notice! For =
the rest of you, we visited respective webpages/ earlier submission and =
did the needful.=20

=20

15 teams are now formed. In the attached list, names are arranged in =
alphabetical order. We request some of you to take additional =
responsibility of jointly coordinating activities of each of the themes. =
These names are indicated in bold, different colour. Kindly oblige. In =
every theme, we kept one of the joint coordinator from IITKGP for =
certain operational requirement (except Theme 14, and in Theme 6, Prof. =
Jayanta Mukhopadhyaya is to take greater responsibility soon).=20

=20

We made small changes in the theme descriptions based on the suggestion =
received. This too is attached. In future, we may see mergers, =
de-mergers of themes based on what each team delivers. While this is to =
happen at domain level due to certain overlaps, there will be similar =
exercise at higher level when input from other domains come; healthcare =
is expected to be important theme in few of the other nine domains.=20

=20

Some of the 15 themes have greater strength in terms of number of =
members. This is because our current research interests are aligned to =
that. At the same time, we need to balance what we want to say and what =
others want to hear. Theme 1 is found important in the Healthcare road =
map of advanced countries, and we cannot avoid coming up with our =
recommendation there.

=20

I take this opportunity to assure coordinators of Theme 1 that my =
voluntary inclusion there may be of some assistance to them even if my =
research interest lies elsewhere. I shall learn (already started =
studying) and may be my http://nssiitkgp.blogspot.in/ background can be =
of some use! Now that the the handle is passed to Theme Coordinators, we =
don't know if they go for poaching members from other teams to =
strengthen theirs :-)=20

=20

Coming to where we go from here, we request each team to come up with a =
short 2 page document by Sept. 30, 2015 for which a simple template is =
attached. Each team is welcome to take help of collaborators to get the =

Prof. Mahim Sagar informed the committee that the
approximately budget for the above purchase would be

Following decisions were taken :

1. The lab will be setup in Bharti School since the

8th floor of Administrative block) may be considered
subject to approval of Institute level Space committee.

2. Head ETSC expressed his willingness to share the
facilities available at ETSC labs for the QIP lectures
till the video conferencing facility is not set-up
for QIP office.

3. Prof. Mahim Sargar requested the committee to finalize
the specification at the earliest and the same should be
submitted to NPIU, Govt. of India.

4. Chairman desired that the specification should include
details of sound proof lecture room, server, camera, talk
back facility, manpower details, call transfer facility,
recording facility, bandwidth requirement etc.

5. Resource person working under Prof. S. Sanghi and
   Prof. Mahim Sagar should discuss about the probable
   specifications and submit it to the committee.

6. Chairman desired that the specification would be a
   general one (not specific to a brand) so that

All the PFC members,

First meeting of the Technical Committee for establishing
Video Conferencing facility for ""Digital outreach of IIT Delhi""
was held in the office of Dean(Faculty) on 6th February, 2015.

Prof. Mahim Sagar attended the meeting as Special Invitee.
Prof. Madhusudan Singh could not attend the meeting due to
short notice given to him. Moreover, he further desired that
his name may be dropped from the committee since he
his area of expertise do not exactly match with the
area of knowledge required for the proposed system.

The committee deliberated on various technical and
operational issues related to the purchase.

The committee unanimously decided to take the technical
help of ETSC for the implementation. The committee also
decided that ETSC should handle and maintain the Hardware
and thus Head ETSC should also be a member of the committee.

The committee further decided that since Dr. Mahim Sagar is
the main driving force behind this implementation, his
name may also be considered for inclusion in the technical
committee.

Dean(Faculty), will take this issue with DD(O) in this regards.

The meeting ended with thanks to the Chair.

autophagy, apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis, and develop novel drug=
s
for the treatment and prevention of various cancers. Prior to my current
research work, I worked on the biophysical characterization of
intrinsically unstructured proteins related to neurodegenerative disease.=
 I
discovered the inhibition of Alpha-synuclein protein (Hallmark of
Parkinson's disease) aggregation in exposure with 14-3-3 eta (a chaperone
protein) by using several biophysical techniques including Atomic Force
Microscope and Fluorescence Polarization Spectroscopy while earning my
doctorate under Prof. Bruno Samori at the University of Bologna, Italy.

As a faculty (Assistant Professor) of Biochem Engg & Biotechnology/ Bio
Sciences School, my  immediate goal will be to create an independent and
ambitious research program focusing on the Drug designing and Drug
discovery for several cancers and neurodegenerative disease. This work wi=
ll
help us to provide better health care facility to the people with
neurodegenerative disease and to provide better treatment for emerging
cancer patients in India. I would like to explore my expertise in academi=
a
and continue my research work in this area. It would be one of the
appropriate places for me to build up my academic carrier with research,
development in a supportive and motivating environment.

I am highly interested in come back to India and serve my life to IIT Del=
hi
to help in building extremely advance academia and research environment. =
I
believe I would be a good fit for the position given that my background
Bioinformatics and Biophysics, and proposed research in Drug Designing an=
d
Drug Discovery mainly focused on naturally derived chemo-preventive agent=
s.


I have attached my Online application, Curriculum Vitae and Cover letter =
in
a single PDF file in this email. Please let me know If I can provide you
with any further information on my background, qualifications and my
research work.

I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you in advance for your time an=

Dear Profs Kale, Kulkarni, and Bolia,

This is with respect to my joining IIT Delhi as Assistant Professor.
Recently, I have developed a significant interest in neuroscience and am
venturing into this area. In order to set a firm foot in this area, I
have decided to spend a year at Princeton Neuroscience Institute.

I am afraid this would mean I will not be able to join IITD faculty in
August, as I intended. I understand that it will not be possible for you
to hold this position for me any further. However, I will still be
interested in being affiliated with IITD in an adjunct or visiting
capacity.

I regret any inconvenience this decision causes and sincerely apologize
for it. It is an honor that you considered me suitable for this position
and I am grateful for the offer. I earnestly thank you for your support
and encouragement during this process.

Kind regards,
Sincerely,
Vaibhav

As we have already decided that the selection process of IITRA faculty

process as being followed by IITD. The Chairman of the selection process 
will the Director of IIT Delhi but with only one change that Executive

I will request you to expedite the selection process because I do not

Interest in visiting IIT Delhi as a Fulbright grant awardee<BR>,"To,
Prof. Kanika T. Bhal, Head
Department of Management Studies
IIT Delhi, India

w/ copies to Prof R. K. Shevgaonkar (Director) and Prof. Kushal Sen (Dean,
Faculty), Prof. Koul Veena (HOC, CBE), and Prof. Ravi Shankar (Professor,
DMS), IIT Delhi, India

Dear Prof. Bhal,

Greetings from California!

I am writing this email to explore the possibility of a mutually beneficial
academic interaction at IIT Delhi, opportunity of which is made possible by
my Fulbright grant award (details provided later in this email
communication).

As a background, I was privileged to have had several interaction
opportunities with faculty and students at IIT Delhi during my past visits
to India spanning over a decade. Most recently I attended the XVI SOM
Conference, which was held at IIT Delhi in December 2012, in which I
participated and presented my research. Following that, I submitted my
research article to Journal of Advances in Management Research in mid-2013,
which Prof. Ravi Shankar (at the Department of Management Studies)
processed and subsequently accepted for publication. I initially contacted
Dr. Shankar in November of 2014 regarding my potential Fulbright engagement
at IIT Delhi. Now that the Fulbright specialist award is official, I am
submitting a formal application to you via this email based on Dr.
Shankar=E2=80=99s encouraging communication.

As an update on my recent activities, I have been on sabbatical for the
entire year 2014 (from January 2014 to December 2014) and have been
traveling within USA and to Europe to pursue fellowships / research
collaborations. From January 2014 to March 2014, I participated a highly
reputed Sabbatical fellowship in Clinical Research Management at the
National Institutes of Health=E2=80=99s (http://www.nih.gov) Clinical Cente=
r in
Washington DC area. [NIH is a primary agency of the US government
responsible for biomedical and health-related research comprising of 27
separate institutes and centers and close interactions with FDA and CDC.]
During this fellowship, I focused on advances in managing clinical research
operations and overseas technology transfer for sustainable healthcare
provision in various settings (besides traditional operations and delivery
of healthcare, medical innovations for disaster settings, humanitarian
emergencies, international development, healthcare informatics, knowledge
management, etc.) in developing economies, with emphasis on Southeast Asia.

During my stay at NIH, I attended electives and interacted with global
experts in medical product development field to learn best practices.
Topics of focus during my NIH sabbatical included: international clinical
research and operations, ethical considerations for new drug development in
developing countries, FDA/regulatory oversight procedures, overseas
technology transfer and clinical trials, advancing translational sciences,
healthcare IT, medical data integrity and security, and minority health and
health disparities considerations. I also worked closely with Fogarty
International Center grant experts on global clinical trial initiatives and
frugal medical innovation initiatives.

Next, I pursued academic/industry/NGO interactions in the field of frugal
innovations in healthcare. I visited six different academic institutions in
Italy and Switzerland in June-July 2014 for follow-up research on
sustainable healthcare innovation policy/operations. I am currently
finishing up academic papers generated from this research stream and
submitting them for publication consideration.

More recently, I have been accepted to the Fulbright Specialist Roster for
the five-year term (2014-2019) in areas of sustainable business
administration (operations / supply chain) and medical product development
by the Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board, the U. S. Department of State=
=E2=80=99s
Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs, and the Council for International
Exchange of Scholars (CIES). During the aforementioned five-year term of
2014-2019, I can be awarded up to two separate Fulbright Specialist awards,
each lasting up to 6 weeks (42 days to be specific). Additional details for
non-US institutions (to invite a US Fulbright scholar) are available on the
following websites:
http://www.cies.org/programs-us-scholars-specialist/non-us-institutions and
http://www.cies.org/programs-us-scholars-specialist/develop-and-submit-spec=
ialist-project-request
.

Based on my past NIH training during the sabbatical fellowship and
follow-up academic interactions in Europe, I strongly feel that I will be
able to make a meaningful contribution at IIT Delhi in advances in
sustainable supply chain operations, medical product supply chains, and
frugal medical (biomedical device) innovation, and to potentially pursue a
joint research agenda with faculty members at IIT in departments of
Management Studies, Mechanical Engineering, and the Centre for Biomedical
Engineering.

I am able to contribute to existing courses offered at IIT Delhi (MEL421:
Production Management, MEP202: Design Innovation and Manufacturing, MEL410:
Creativity in Engineering, MEL420: Total Quality Management, MEL422:
Project Management, MEL756: Supply Chain Management, MEL768: Quality
Management: A Systems Perspective, etc.). Furthermore, I will be happy to
design on new course on Frugal Innovation in Medical Devices for Centre for
Biomedical Engineering based on my research at NIH.

The Fulbright Specialist award that I received allows engagement of up to a
6 weeks (42 days to be specific), either all in one visit or in multiple
visits (say 3 visits of 2 weeks each). For Fulbright awardees,
accommodation are customarily handled by the host institution. I will be
requiring accommodation in ITT campus during my Fulbright-enabled visit.

Please let me know if there will be interest in further exploring this
interaction possibility in the coming years. If so, I will be happy to send
you my curriculum vitae and other Fulbright specialist award-specific
information. I look forward to hearing from you to further discuss topic
presented herewith.

Thank you in anticipation,

Best regards,

Dear Sir,



I am writing to apply for the Assistant Professor position in the Indian
Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi). I am currently a Post-Doctoral
Associate at Center for Science, Technology, and Environmental Policy,
Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs University of Minnesota, USA.=
 I
obtained my Ph.D. in 2011, thesis entitled =E2=80=9CModeling of Urban Tra=
ffic
Emissions=E2=80=9D from Centre for Transportation Systems (CTRANS), India=
n
Institute of Technology Roorkee (IIT Roorkee). In the past four years, I
have been fortunate to work at University of Minnesota, US Environmental
Protection Agency (USEPA), North Carolina State University (NCSU) and IIT
Roorkee, which provided me a chance to carry out cutting edge research in
the area of environmental science and engineering.  My research focuses o=
n
traffic emission modeling, urban emission inventory development, air
quality and health risk assessment, trans-boundary infrastructure footpri=
nt
and municipal solid waste burning.  This helped me to build a broader
perspective about my preferences in opting for a research career.



I began my research career as a research fellow in project entitled
=E2=80=9CMegacities and Global Change: An integrated study of South Asian
megacities emission and their local-to-global impacts on air quality and
climate=E2=80=9D at Civil Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Tec=
hnology
Roorkee. In this project I have worked on estimation and analysis of air
pollutant emission from various sectors (i.e. transportation, agriculture
and thermal power)   of South Asian Megacities (i.e. Delhi, Mumbai and
Kolkata). As a part of my Ph.D. thesis, I developed a Vehicular Air
Pollution Inventory (VAPI) Model for developing countries which is the
first of its kind in India (http://www.vapimodel.com/).



My postdoctoral research at NCSU was focused upon: (1) modernizing models
and data on methane emissions from USA landfills, (2) transportation ener=
gy
economy optimization modeling and CO2 emissions. As a Post-Doctoral
Associate at University of Minnesota, my research focuses on methodology
development for disaggregated emission inventory of urban areas of
developing country, methodology development for solid waste burning
estimation in urban area, and trans-boundary infrastructure emissions
footprints. I strongly feel that my experience of working in an
interdisciplinary environment would be very useful in pursuing research o=
n
urban air pollution monitoring/modeling, emissions inventory development
with various approaches and health risk assessment through collaboration
with the diversified faculties at IIT Delhi.



I am also interested in pursuing teaching. I believe that IIT Delhi
provides a great intellectual atmosphere to accomplish that. I have taugh=
t
lectures at both undergraduate and graduate levels. As a teacher, I inten=
d
to devise new techniques for classrooms, which will encourage student
learning and promote problem solving. I eagerly look forward to the
opportunity to teach and interact with IIT Delhi students. My background
prepares me to teach specialized courses on Environmental Change and
Sustainable development, waste to energy and ecology and environment,.
These courses will be useful for the students to enhance cutting edge
skills in air pollution and emissions analysis to foster their career in
industry and academia. I have always felt that research and teaching go
hand in hand, and this position at IIT Delhi, would provide me with a
chance to carry out research and teaching at an equally high level.



Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and considering my
application for the faculty position in  IIT Delhi. I am excited about ho=
w
well matched the IIT Delhi, is for me while preparing my application and =
I
hope that the feeling is mutual.   Kindly find my detail resume attached

Re: English language instructors in HSS Dept.<BR>,"Dear Prof. Sen,

Following up on our conversation pertaining to English Language 
Instructors in our language lab., my office informs me that their 
appointment is contractual for one year, extendable to 3 yrs after which 
we have to hold fresh interviews. I suppose this means that people 
cannot be hired permanently under these posts.

As you suggested, these posts should perhaps be made permanent as the 
courses run by them, NLN100 and HUL 810, are part of the IITD curriculum 
and to be taught necessarily.

In fact, for a long time we have requested that two more such posts are 
required due to the large no. of students that the instructors have to 
handle. The instructors are also teaching IIT staff who wish to 
undertake English Language Training.

I would be grateful if you could look into this matter and expedite 
creation of two more posts and explore whether these can be made 
permanent.

Thanks and best regards,

Ravinder Kaur
Head, HSS

Please see the forwarded mail attached here with being forwarded to 
webmaster for necessary action. How can a department send such mails 
without understanding the operational issues. Once the candidate submits 
(submit means no change after that) how can we tell the candidate to 
update the information against thier application. It is not a open ended 
system we cant leave the system open where the candidate can make change 
at any time

On the appraisal front one of the Hod is making comment such as we have 
made a Jugad system.  Does that faculty member knows by making such 
comment to my team member what kind of damage that he/she is doing to my 
team members morale. We have followed a structure what ever was defined

I am sorry to say I cant work in this environment anymore, let me enjoy

Dear Prof.


Greetings



I hope, this mail will find you in good spirit and the best of your healt=
h.



First of all, I would like to introduce my self. I (Alok Kumar Rai) am
presently working as a Research Professor in Chonnam National University,
Gwangju, South Korea. I have finished my doctoral degree in Applied
Chemistry in 2010 *from **Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu
University (IIT-BHU)*, Varanasi. After that, I came here in South Korea a=
s
a postdoctoral fellow in 2010. Here, I did extremely well in the hot
research area of lithium ion (Li+ ion) and post-lithium ion (Na+, K+ ion)
batteries for energy applications. I have also handled all the required
instruments during my postdoctoral research. Here, I got good exposure an=
d
learned so many things regarding new materials with their different
morphology and their novel synthesis and characterization techniques...et=
c.
I have a very good experimental hand and strong background for the
synthesis and characterizations of nano-materials, oxide materials and
electrode materials for battery systems.


More importantly, I have been promoted as a Research Professor in the sam=
e
university since 2013 due to my impressive performance.


*I have almost 4 years of postdoctoral research experience in abroad in t=
he
hot research area of materials science for energy applications*.* In
addition, during these Ph.D and postdoctoral tenure, I have **also
**published
nearly 41 papers in the peer reviewed international journals*. The detail=
s
of my achievement can be found in my resume that I have attached herewith=
.


At present, I am interested to further my career in India. In this contex=
t,
I would be interested to work under your supervision in your esteemed
institute. I am fully motivated to initiate the job at any capacity relat=
ed
to my area of research.


I believe that my research experience in Indian Institute of Technology,
Banaras Hindu University (IIT-BHU) during Ph.D programme and my
postdoctoral research experience in South Korea will be suitable to match
the job requirements in your esteemed institute.  I have also provided
references in my detailed CV for your kind perusal.


Prof. the work which I am doing here is almost new topics for India. Very
few peoples are working in the same topic in South India, that is still n=
ot
very satisfactory. In addition, I have also written a detailed proposal,
which contained my research plans for future research.


I further wish to state that if given an opportunity, I would prove of it
and provide my best service to make significant contribution to your
esteemed institute.


Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider my case and provide me an
opportunity to serve you.


Eagerly waiting your favorable response.


Thanking you with best regards

 hand with Systems approach. 

 Each 
 organization has a unique EHS culture. It is critical to understand
and 
 manage organizationâs EHS culture in order to maintain positive EHS

 performance. EHS performance is most often driven by employee actions
and 
 behaviors, which are largely a product of the EHS culture within an 
 organization. In order to manage EHS performance, companies must be
able 
 to understand and manage their organizationâs EHS culture. 

 */An 
 organizationâs EHS culture is a product of an organizationâs
values, 
 perceptions, attitudes, patterns of behavior, and competencies that
define 
 the style, proficiency of, and commitment to the organizationâs EHS

 management./*

 EHS culture 
 can be assessed through EHS regulatory compliance, conformance to 
 management system elements, site observation, and candid employee
feedback 
 besides Safety perception surveys from all levels within the
organization. 
 Together, these elements give an experienced culture assessor a
strong 
 understanding of the EHS culture at an organization. If any
opportunities 
 for improvement are identified as a result of the culture assessment,

 action plans should be created and steps taken to improve the EHS
culture, 
 which should in turn improve EHS performance. The actions required
will be 
 specific to findings identified during the cultural assessment, but
can 
 include: improvement of accountability, development of strong EHS
vision, 
 establishment of senior management buy-in, improvements in
communication, 
 establishment of trust between various levels of staff, development
of 
 stated responsibilities, and implementation of process changes.
Evaluating 
 and understanding your EHS culture will help determine whether that 
 culture supports your organizationâs EHS objectives.

 background, CII Southern Region is organising an Online master class

PSS design incorporates innovative strategies that shift businesses away
from designing and selling physical products to developing integrated
systems of products and services. This book provides background, advice and
tools for designers and design students interested in sustainable PSS and
has a wealth of case studies for practitioners to digest. The first part of
the book introduces the concept of PSS innovation, outlining the
characteristics
and features of such innovation, how different types of PSS can be
classified, and the related benefits, drivers and barriers. It argues that
such innovation has the capability to potentially bring radical reductions =
in
the current levels of resource consumption without minimizing consumer
levels of satisfaction. The second part of the book examines a wide range
of potential research directions on sustainable PSS design including:

   - Sustainable PSS in different socio-economic contexts (industrialized,
   emerging and low income)
   - Sustainable PSS in different organizational bodies (companies, public
   administrations, NGOs)
   - Sustainable PSS and consumption patterns
   - Sustainable PSS and social innovations
   - Sustainable PSS and aesthetics
   - Sustainable PSS and distributed economies
   - Sustainable PSS and social enterprises
   - Sustainable PSS and socio-technical transitions
   - Sustainable PSS and the sufficiency economy: combining efficiency with
   sufficiency

Fwd: status of Nalanda 321<BR>,"Dear Prof Sen

This is to bring to your notice the condition of renovated transit Apt 
of Nalanda for our newly joined faculty. I am forwarding mail from Dr 
Subodh Sharma who was allotted #321.

Look into the matter and see that proper accommodation should be 
provided. Faculty should not run around getting initial work done before 
possession.

Regards,

Saroj Kaushik

-------- Original Message --------
Subject: status of Nalanda 321
Date: 21.05.2015 11:13

Dear Prof. Kaushik,

On May 19, 2015 the estate office allotted Nalanda 321 to me as a 
temporary residence unit and issued me the terms and conditions that 
must be followed. I went to the unit today and to my surprise the unit 
is in a very bad shape. I am attaching some photographs that I took of 
the unit today which the estate office feels that is ready for 
allottment. It is not livable. I told some of the people in the estate 
office about the state of the unit and they brushed it under the carpet 
saying that the unit requires only little cleaning which can be done in 
no time and I should go ahead and take the keys, an oft repeated 
argument on which I have little faith left.

The terms and conditions for occupation of the unit mention that the 
unit has to be occupied within 5 days of the issue of the letter of 
allotment. Additionally, in the event of failing to occupy the unit I 
will be debarred to apply for any accommodation under all categories for 
a period ranging from 6 months to 3 years. Given the state of the unit 
and restrictive circular, I find myself in a predicament. My current 
temporary accommodation at the Faculty Guest House is more livable than 
what is offered.

In light of these facts I kindly request you to follow it up with Dean 
Faculty or any relevant authority.

With best regards,

Fwd: Regd AMC of our HPC from CMC<BR>,"Dear Prof Koul,
This is regarding our AMC of the HPC at the Centre (CAS).
Last week, we had discussed with you and as suggested by you, I wrote an 
email to Dr Subrahmanian Krishnan, Chief of the TCS, requesting him to 
honour our AMC agreement made earlier with CMC Limited. I have no 
response to my first mail as well as second one.

I have come to know that Mr Subramanian is coming tomorrow to IIT in 
connection with Knowledge Park. I request you to raise this issue with 
him and use your good offices to convince him for agreeing our AMC so 
that the Centre will be benefited.

Kind regards, A D Rao

Subject: Regd AMC of our HPC from CMC
Date: 08.12.2015 16:48

Dear Mr Krishnan,
I am writing this mail to you on the suggestion of Prof S K Koul, Deputy 
Director, IIT Delhi.

This is in connection with AMC and Facility Management Services(FMS) 
provided by CMC Ltd for one of our HPC at Centre for Atmospheric 
Sciences, IIT Delhi.

We prepared supply order (copy attached) for AMC and FMS for a period of 
two years as quoted (copy attached) by CMC Ltd. However, we are 
surprised to receive an informal communication from the CMC Ltd 
mentioning that they can't accept our supply order due to amalgamation 
of CMC Ltd with TCS Ltd from 1 October 2015 (email copy attached).

We were never informed by the CMC Ltd during the preparation of Supply 
Order regarding the merger and its impact on our supply order. This 
AMC/FMS of our HPC is very crucial for the continuity of our R&D 
activities at CAS.

I will really appreciate if you could help us in making sure that our 
supply order is being honored by CMC/TCS Ltd. Your intervention in this 
regard will strengthen the long lasting relationship between IIT Delhi 
and TCS Ltd.

Looking forward for a favorable response from you.
Best Regards, A D Rao

Subject: Request to be on the Security Advisory Board (SAB) of Goods and=20
Services Tax Network, SPV created by GoI and all States
Date: 03.11.2015 16:34

Dear Sir,

Goods And Services Tax Network (GSTN) has been established as a special
purpose vehicle by Government of India to provide IT infrastructure and
services to the Central and State Governments, tax payers and other
stakeholders for implementation of the GOODS AND SERVICES TAX (GST)
which is expected to subsume in itself practically all indirect taxes
prevailing in the country, including the three major indirect taxes
viz., Central Excise, Service Tax and VAT. GSTN would, thus, play a
critically important role in reforming the indirect tax system in India
and will be creating a critical national information infrastructure.

GSTN was incorporated as not for profit private limited company on March
28, 2013. The Government of India holds 24.5% equity in the Company and
all States of the Indian Union, including NCT of Delhi and Puducherry,
together hold another 24.5%. Balance 51% equity is with five
non-Government financial institutions, none of them holding more than
11%.

As GSTN would be handling sensitive data of the taxpayers across India,
security of the data is of utmost importance. Taking this factor into
consideration, the Board of GSTN intends to constitute a Security
Advisory Board (SAB) that would provide guidance to GSTN on information
security and privacy related matters. Details on roles and
responsibilities and other related matters pertaining to SAB are given
below.

Based on discussion with Data Security Council of India (DSCI) and
senior government officials handling cyber security in the government,
we are approaching you to be on the Security Advisory Board of GSTN.
Your early confirmation will help us issue the notification and convene
the first meeting of the SAB. Recently we have awarded the work of
development of GST Systems to Infosys and guidance of SAB from this
stage will be critical for creating a secured national information
infrastructure.

Dr Gulshan Rai has kindly agreed to chair the Security Advisory Board
(SAB).

A line of confirmation will be highly appreciated.

Prakash Kumar

Re: Ms Excel Template for all Store Officers and PS to HoDs<BR>,"For the limited purpose that Kalyan promised yesterday,
this spread-sheet may be enough.

But actually some time back Kalyan had also produced a
flow-diagram of the stores-purchase process.

Considering that vendors often badger Heads saying
repeatedly that they have not received payments for various
purchases, it occurred to me that the spread-sheet should
be expanded to reflect the various milestones in the store-purchase
flow-diagram that Kalyan had earlier produced.  The completion of
each milestone in the flow diagram could merely be a date and
a despatch number.

There should also be a column for the final RTGS and UTR nos
when payment has been made. We always get requests from other
organizations to produce the UTR since they often deny that the RTGS
ever came.

This would in effect be a manual tracking process to be undertaken
by PAs and storekeepers so that Heads get to to know the state at
which the purchase process has stagnated for each item.

These spread-sheets could also be analysed to figure out where the
major bottlenecks and delays are. Currently we only have claims and
counter-claims.

In the absence of a good ERP system we will have to make do with some
manual tracking in which PAs could help store-keepers, who are often
quite over-worked in this matter.

"Newsletter ""Connections"" from IIT Gandhinagar<BR>","Dear Friend of IIT Gandhinagar:
 
I am pleased to share with you the exciting news that IIT
Gandhinagarâs Construction Workersâ Welfare Program won the
national HUDCO Award for âBest Practices to Improve the Living
Environment 2013-14"" on April 25. The award recognizes both
institutional commitments to construction workersâ welfare and
safety, as well as IITGN's community volunteer programme Nyasa. 
 
At IIT Gandhinagar, we view social engagement as a central pillar of
our educational and institutional mission and it is one of the core
values that we attempt to inculcate in our new undergraduate students
through the five-week immersion Foundation Programme. We are very
happy that even though so much of our energies must necessarily be
directed toward development as a new and growing institution, we have
remained committed to our larger social obligations.
 
The latest edition of our quarterly newsletter Connections reports on
significant developments at the Institute during the January to March
2014 quarter. Eight IITGN students, who won the UL-IITGN Water
Challenge to develop a platform for drinking water station for
community use, will be heading to Underwriters Laboratories in Chicago
this summer to undertake the implementation phase of their projects.
We hosted numerous speakers and workshops, and our students organised
the popular intra-college sports festival Halla Bol and the fifth
edition of the student cultural festival Blithchron. You will find
these and other major developments in our newsletter at
http://www.iitgn.ac.in/pdf/connections/Vol6-Issue3.pdf

Thank you for your support over the years. Many of our initiatives,
including the construction workers programmes, are possible because of
the generous support of our donors. Details on making a contribution
to IIT Gandhinagar are available at http://donate.iitgn.ac.in

Sincerely, and with best regards,

TEACH OR PERISH

Matt Roth for The Chronicle Review

By Jacques Berlinerblau

My undergraduates=E2=80=99 career plans are a peculiar mix of naked ambit=
ion
and hair-shirt altruism. If they pursue investment banking, they do so
not merely to make money. Rather, they wish to use their eventual wealth
to distribute solar light bulbs to every resident of a developing
nation. They=E2=80=99ll apply to the finest law schools in hopes of some =
day
judging war criminals at The Hague. Countless want to code. They dream
of engineering an app that will make tequila flow out of thin air into
your outstretched shot glass. My students, I suspect, are receiving
their professional advice from a council of emojis.

There is one occupation, however, that rarely figures in their reveries.
Few of these kids hanker to become professors. Maybe that=E2=80=99s becau=
se
undergraduates no longer believe that the university is where the life
of the mind is lived. Or perhaps they are endowed with acute emotional
intelligence; they intuit that their instructors are sort of sad and
broken on the inside. It=E2=80=99s also possible that the specter of ento=
mbing
oneself in a study carrel does not appeal to them.

I guess they must also read those headlines, the ones suggesting that
the liberal arts as we know them, and the scholars who toil within, are
about to get rolled. I rehearse, with light annotation, some of these
headlines here. Tenure-track positions in the humanities
are=E2=80=94poof!=E2=80=94continually evaporating. Contingent faculty mak=
e up around
75 percent of educators in postsecondary institutions. To read an
account of a part-timer=E2=80=99s daily grind is like reading _One Day in=
 the
Life of Ivan Denisovich._

Then there are the stories about MOOCs, ""outcome based"" online start-up
colleges, and other forms of curricular disruption. Awash in VC cash,
such initiatives portend the final, ignominious breakdown of the
professorial status quo. They augur a future when even fewer (underpaid,
contingent) scholars will serve swelling numbers of students. Job
markets are fluxing into oblivion, and I surmise that our young charges
have taken notice of that, too.

Some observers contend that the headlines are overwrought. The academy
has endured crises before and has adapted. And who=E2=80=99s to say that
faculty members had it so good in the past? Ever read a campus novel,
like John Williams=E2=80=99s _Stoner_ or Mary McCarthy=E2=80=99s _Groves =
of Academe
_or Randall Jarrell=E2=80=99s _Pictures From an Institution_? Do those
fictional scholars of bygone eras seem existentially content and
professionally fulfilled?

Those novels chronicled some well-known infirmities of our vocation
(e.g., infinite hours, philistinism run amok, Midwestern college towns).
Those problems continue to vex. Couple them with the grim headlines and
it becomes difficult to remain optimistic. With all due respect to the
it=E2=80=99s-not-that-bad crowd, it=E2=80=99s bad enough. I=E2=80=99m goi=
ng to assume
it=E2=80=99s bad enough for a 53-year-old adjunct. I=E2=80=99ll venture t=
hat it=E2=80=99s
pretty unbearable for the grad student whose debts mount while her job
interviews dwindle. I know it=E2=80=99s pretty depressing for the countle=
ss
tenured professors who often tell me that they will not advise their
best undergraduates to pursue doctorates. What does it say about a
profession when its most successful members stand ready to discourage
apprentices=E2=80=94apprentices who, I hasten to add, do not exist?

We humanists are at an inflection point, careering down the steep
gradient like terrified campers on a mammoth water slide. We accelerate
into the bottomless future, arms flailing, mouths wide open, eyes
closed, gowns streaming behind us. Where=E2=80=99d our caps go? How did i=
t
come to this? How did such an august body find itself in this
undignified position?

Like the downfall of an empire, the collapse of something as complex as
the professoriate defies simple monocausal analysis. There is,
undoubtedly, a multitude of factors that account for our plight. Many
are beyond our control and culpability, like decreased public funding
for higher education and America=E2=80=99s inveterate anti-intellectualis=
m.

That said, we can and should be held accountable for all sorts of
inanities. If the nation=E2=80=99s humanities faculty consulted a life co=
ach,
even a representative of that peppy and platitudinous guild would
conclude that we have made some bad decisions. It was not unwarranted to
pose political questions in our research. We erred, however, in
politicizing inquiry to the extent that we did. There is nothing wrong
with importing theory into studies of literature, art, cinema, and so
forth. It was ill-advised to bring so _much_ theory=E2=80=94and almost al=
ways
the same dense and ideologically tinctured brand of it=E2=80=94to bear on=
 our
vast canon of texts and traditions.

But no decision we ever made could have been more catastrophic than this
one: Somewhere along the way, we spiritually and emotionally disengaged
from teaching and mentoring students. The decision=E2=80=94which certainl=
y
hasn=E2=80=99t ingratiated us to the job-seeking generation=E2=80=94has r=
esulted in
one whopper of a contradiction. While teaching undergraduates is,
normally, a large part of a professor=E2=80=99s job, _success in our fiel=
d is
correlated with a professor=E2=80=99s ability to avoid teaching
undergraduates._

It follows from this contradiction that the more accomplished the
scholar, the less she or he is required to engage with students.
Prestigious institutions perpetuate this logic by freeing their most
distinguished faculty members from classroom responsibilities. Such
luminaries, of course, might be asked to teach a small graduate course
in their area of microspecialization. Or they might speak at multitudes
of underclassmen in a stadium-size auditorium. These stars will be
shielded by a battalion of teaching assistants, lest they be disquieted
by some sophomore=E2=80=99s imbecilic concern about her midterm grade.

Permit me to illustrate these contradictions with a personal example.
When I was an adjunct, teaching at (criminally) underfunded public
community colleges and universities, I would cobble together six courses
in the fall and six more in the spring. When I won the lottery and
received a tenure-track job at a midlevel institution, I graduated to a
3-3. After improbably hitting another jackpot and making it to an elite
university, I now enjoy the luxury of a 2-1. I have never been so
garlanded in my field as to receive the 0-1 or the vaunted ""double
zero""=E2=80=94the mark of exemplary scholarly achievement.

We live by the unspoken creed that teaching is, well, not really what
one is supposed to be doing. Conversely, doing a lot of teaching is
construed as a sign that one is not doing well. This perverse reasoning
leads scholars to conjure up all manner of strategies geared to evading
the lectern and maximizing undisturbed research time. In their ingenuity
and inventiveness, these tactics have the quality of grift. There are
those who robo-teach scads of extra classes for a few consecutive
semesters, including summers, so as to bank years of liberty. There are
""bishops"" who convince some higher-up that they can function as part of
the magisterium of the college by taking up residence indefinitely in a
city far, far away. There are those who barter with deans to remain on
sabbatical in perpetuity. Anything to avoid the servitude of the
syllabus.

Of course, somebody=E2=80=99s gotta teach all those undergraduates=E2=80=94=
they
won=E2=80=99t teach themselves! A tremendous debt of gratitude is owed to=
 the
so-called losers=E2=80=94the full- and part-timers who teave and slave in
classrooms with students. I salute them. But it must be acknowledged
that many of these hard-working scholars would eagerly shuck aside all
those fresh-faced freshmen in exchange for a double zero. As teachers
they don=E2=80=99t lack for industry; they lack for passion.

How we arrived at a point where teaching is reckoned as a burden and a
stigma is not a story I can recount here. The retreat from the classroom
is like that long stretch of highway you navigated to get home but
can=E2=80=99t recall in any detail. We obviously went down that road as a
guild=E2=80=94we just can=E2=80=99t remember when or how. Now we=E2=80=99=
re here. It may
be too late to turn back.

In many ways, we resemble the ailing magazine, newspaper, and taxi
industries: crippled by challenges we never imagined, risks we never
calculated, queries we never posed. Here are some questions we didn=E2=80=
=99t
ask but really should have: Was it sustainable to configure a field so
that the quality and (mostly) quantity of peer-reviewed research became
the unrivaled metric by which status and advancement were attained?
Ought we to have investigated whether there exists a point of
diminishing returns=E2=80=94a line beyond which too much publication, too=
 much
specialization, becomes intellectually counterproductive? Why did we
fail to examine the long-term impact on both students and scholars of
having the latter so singularly focused on publishing? Why did we not
promote the ideal of professors equally skilled in both research and
instruction? Why did we invest so little thought in puzzling through how
teaching excellence could result in tenure? Was it wise never to train
graduate students how to write clearly, speak publicly, and teach
effectively?

For a guild that prides itself on research, we sure didn=E2=80=99t invest=
 much
effort into what the corporate folk call ""research and development."" Who
was thinking about the consequences of our inadvertent drift away from
students in the final decades of the 20th century? And who=E2=80=99s thin=
king
about it now?

I don=E2=80=99t want to sound like a TED talker, but the fundamental shif=
t in
higher education is going to go something like this: We=E2=80=99re moving=
 from
an era in which we prized accumulating knowledge to one in which we
equally prize its transmission. Professors are failing to deliver, as it
were. This leaves us fatally exposed to challenges that are unnerving
and in some cases unprecedented.

Let=E2=80=99s start with a political climate in which the size and role o=
f
government is being strenuously contested. Many elected officials,
usually of the Republican persuasion, appear disinclined to allocate
funds to The U. They are revolting against a longstanding civic compact
whose cheerful, mid-20th-century ration=C2=ADale could be charted as
follows:

The commonwealth apportions tax monies to a public university. This
institution teems with experts whose scholarly judgment we trust. These
savants offer a tenure-track line to a scholar of great promise, who is
permitted to spend a semester furrowing through an archive in Belarus
for the juvenilia of a formidable but unknown poetess. He then
subsequently shares his specialized insights, upon his chipper return to
the States, with appreciative undergraduates, who, of course, then
graduate and enrich America=E2=80=99s culture and future.

Conservative figures across the nation have endeavored to bludgeon every
single phoneme of this flow chart. They trust neither the public
institutions, nor the scholars in their employ, nor their promise for
the American future. Embroiled in a raucous debate about funding for the
University of North Carolina, Gov. Patrick McCrory recently said [2] to
William Bennett, ""If you want to take gender studies, that=E2=80=99s fine=
=E2=80=94go
to a private school and take it. But I don=E2=80=99t want to subsidize th=
at if
that=E2=80=99s not going to get someone a job.""

On his website, McCrory speaks of the need to ""align higher education
with changing market needs."" The public, he contends, along with many
other Republicans, is entitled to receive a quantifiable public good
from public dollars. To a certain extent, the Obama administration, with
its blurry vision of rating [3] colleges according to ""labor-market
outcomes,"" shares this rationale. Much of America=E2=80=99s leadership cl=
ass
doubts that courses in Victorian literature, or functionalist sociology,
or the Harlem Renaissance do much for the commonweal.

It=E2=80=99s a deceptively difficult argument to neutralize. Scholars
generally push back by uttering something about ""critical-thinking
skills."" We=E2=80=99ve been reflexively mouthing that line for decades. A=
s we
say it, however, our thoughts are actually concentrated on making next
week=E2=80=99s deadline for a research grant. What we really need to argu=
e,
or, better yet, prove, is that the college classroom and its personnel
transmit lessons and intangibles that are invaluable to the nation=E2=80=99=
s
well-being.

Jobs? Surely someone over in the B-school has demonstrated that
better-educated employees are more productive employees. Innovation? We
respond that an ensemble of challenging courses in the liberal arts,
including gender studies, incubates innovation. Market needs? Our view
is that through mentorship a professor helps undergraduates
pragmatically ponder their proper vocational niches. Citizenship? We
hold that learning how to be an American takes place in a seminar where
people argue, civilly but intensely, about ideas. What other national
institution offers up such deliverables?

Two conservative writers, Jonathan Riehl and Scot Faulkner, invoked some
of these themes in a rejoinder [4] to McCrory. They chastened the
Republican governor for espousing ""anticonservative"" principles. ""The
notion of colleges and universities as factories for job-performance,""
they wrote, ""smacks much more of leftist, socialist societies where
individuals were not valued for their knowledge or perception but for
their ability to perform tasks."" They also doubted that McCrory=E2=80=99s
initiatives would make graduates more competitive in global markets. ""Is
it not practical in preparation for entering the work force,"" ask the
authors, ""to have read deeply in philosophy, cultural history, politics
and literature?""

Those are the types of talking points that all professors should be
voicing. Whether we are conservatives, liberals, or radical leftists,
whether we work in private or public institutions, whether we are
contingent or noncontingent faculty, we need to proclaim these truths
together. Regrettably, we are so comically atomized as a guild that
we=E2=80=99ll never unite to protect our mutual interests.

But an even bigger impediment is that we can=E2=80=99t make any of the ab=
ove
claims in good faith. That=E2=80=99s because so few actually retain the
commitment to teaching that powers the Narrative of Righteous Professors
and Mentors whose contours I have just sketched. In theory, many great
things can happen in the American college classroom. In practice, our
upside-down set of priorities assures that those things occur far less
frequently than they should. After all, that fellow in the archive is
doing everything he can to spend another year in Belarus. And then
another.

To effectively neutralize increasingly common assaults such as
McCrory=E2=80=99s, we need to demonstrate that professors are deeply inve=
sted
in, and committed to, the minds of undergraduates. Not just a few
professors. All professors. Every provost in the United States can trot
out a dozen ringers. These are scholars who reek of chalk and marker,
who stock linens and pillows in their offices, who are masters of
conveying their expertise. Mentoring, for them, is no act of altruism
but a moral injunction. These creatures do exist. But they are the
exception, not the norm. My fear is that if we don=E2=80=99t multiply the=
ir
presence very quickly (but how?), our crisis will grow deeper.

Our disarticulation of knowledge accumulation and knowledge transmission
also leaves us exposed to an even more frightening adversary. I refer to
tech and its maniacal destabilizing energy. Financiers have recognized
that there=E2=80=99s good money to be made in conveying knowledge; their
thoughts, naturally, do not linger on the costly infrastructure that
produces knowledge. Working in tandem with the digital wizards, they
wager that they can do it better than we can and cash out in the
process. Given that they=E2=80=99re up against a cohort that has very lit=
tle
interest, or dexterity, in sharing its immense store of wisdom, the
money and tech people like their odds.

So do I. The specs on this showdown suggest a brutal smackdown. We are
old. They are young. We are risk-averse. They posit chaos as a
sacrament. We are locked into traditions of inquiry centuries in the
making. They like to ""break shit."" [5] We see an undergraduate as a
speed bump en route to a research project. They see an undergraduate as
something to be monetized. We scrimp to provide a visiting lecturer with
a $150 honorarium. They are connected to reserves of capital
unimaginable just a decade back. We are an abacus. They are an iPad.

I think we should sue for peace=E2=80=94a humiliating peace insofar as ou=
r
conquerors haven=E2=80=99t even made it past their 10-year reunion. The
digital technologies they fabricate are already driving classroom
innovation. I sometimes wonder, though, if the present enthusiasm for
alternative pedagogies, like ""flipped classrooms,"" is a 21st-century
virtue born of a late-20th-century vice. The art of college-classroom
teaching had fallen into complete disrepair. Simply put, having
professors do what they=E2=80=99d been doing for the past few centuries w=
as no
longer viable.

Enter the new masters with their cyber-superpowers and hoodies. They
have imparted to us, their teachers, an abiding truth about the
humanist=E2=80=99s ethos: What you can help others know is as valuable as=
 what
you know.

The adage ""publish or perish"" is outdated, almost sinister in its
misdirection. For the truth is that many well-published Ph.D.=E2=80=99s a=
re
out of academe altogether. At colleges across the country, there labor
underemployed scholars with stellar CVs. Their accomplishments, at least
in the first decade beyond their thesis defense, are usually comparable
to those of their far less numerous tenured counterparts. The slogan we
lived by is, empirically speaking, false. It really should have read
""publish _and _perish."" If the metric of success in our profession is a
tenure-track position at a liberal-arts college, then most of our recent
doctorates are perishing.

As for today=E2=80=99s graduate students, how different they are from
today=E2=80=99s emoji-driven undergraduates. A few years back, the former=
 did
hanker to become professors. Most of them probably still do=E2=80=94thoug=
h
maybe they wish they had listened more carefully to their faculty
mentors, assuming they had one.

When forlorn A.B.D.=E2=80=99s in the humanities ask me for advice, I reco=
mmend
that they think in terms of ""teach or perish."" Society will always need
skilled transmitters of knowledge. But another peer-reviewed article on
the ""circulation of Enlightenment triumphalism"" in Thomas Hardy=E2=80=99s
_Tess of the D=E2=80=99Urbervilles,_ not so much. Don=E2=80=99t get me wr=
ong. _Tess

afterlife should be experienced in the minds of students, their awe for
the novel=E2=80=99s innumerable charms ignited by a professor. That _Tess=
=E2=80=99_s
fate is linked to our own is a probability I won=E2=80=99t address here.

If all the dour reflections above are accurate=E2=80=94if they are
half-accurate=E2=80=94we will need to rethink our priorities and core
concerns. The kindergarten instructor, I surmise, likes those little
tykes, thinks they=E2=80=99re cute. I have met seventh-grade teachers who
reveal to me why they work in middle schools: They are mesmerized by the
dorky majesty that is the mind of a child age 11 or 12. In this spirit,
I submit a re-visioning of an American college professor=E2=80=99s job
description: The successful candidate will be skilled in, and
passionately devoted to, teaching and mentoring 18- to 22-year-olds, as
well as those in other age groups. Additionally, she or he will show
promise as an original and creative researcher.

_Jacques Berlinerblau is a professor of Jewish civilization in the
Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. His
most recent book is _Secularism on the Edge: Re-thinking Church-State

 *Dear Sir / Madam,*



 I take the pleasure to inform you that the *Indian Chamber of Commerce
(ICC)* is organizing conference on *=E2=80=9C100 Smart Cities=E2=80=9D,* =
supported by
*Ministry of Urban Development, Govt of India,* on *10 February 2015 at L=
e
Meridien, New Delhi*. The theme of the conference is *=E2=80=9CNeed for
Innovative and Integrated Approach=E2=80=9D.*



 I am happy to inform you that *Shri S Venkaiah Naidu, *Hon=E2=80=99ble U=
nion
Minister, Ministry of Urban Development, Govt. of India has kindly
confirmed to address the conference as the *=E2=80=9CChief Guest=E2=80=9D=
.*



 The conference is in line with the *Prime Minister=E2=80=99s* vision to =
set up
100 smart cities in India and would address the issues in identified area=
s
underpin the expectations of the State Governments from the Central
Government as well as the private players and draw up the strategy for
future course of action. The four corridors viz., Delhi-Mumbai,
Bangalore-Chennai, Amritsar-Kolkata and Vizag-Chennai=E2=80=94for buildin=
g smart
cities identified by the Govt. of India encompasses most of the states in
the country. The success of this vision is highly dependent on
*Centre-State-corporate coordination* in terms of policy decision and
implementation, technology, identifying action areas & business
opportunities etc. and for that it is important to understand the
*stakeholders=E2=80=99 perspectives*, their views and suggestion about th=
e
vision, *issues in identified areas and expectations from Central and Sta=
te
Government*. *The conference would also enumerate on available business
opportunities and maximize private sector co-operation for successful
implementation of the project.*



 Whether India builds new cities, or extends and develops existing ones, =
it
needs a new technology friendly city governance model that is =E2=80=98fa=
ster,
better and cheaper=E2=80=99. Smart cities herald a new age where informat=
ion
technology, in addition to roads, buildings or bridges forms the core
infrastructure to enable the government to provide more efficient service=
s,
maintain a low carbon footprint and create an entrepreneurial environment
for its citizens.



 With this background, ICC is organizing *=E2=80=9C100 Smart Cities=E2=80=
=9D *which
would serve as an important platform to bring forth the investment and
growth opportunities in the smart city model and link up the stakeholders
for the purpose of business development.



 I am happy to inform you that *Urban Development Secretaries* of *Kerala=
,*
*Gujrat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Chattishgarh, and Rajasthan *have already
confirmed their presence and address at the conference.



 I would also like to share with you that the following dignitaries,
amongst others, have confirmed their participation in the conference -



   - *Shri Shankar Aggarwal,* IAS, Secretary, Ministry of Urban
Development, GoI

 a)       Create a platform for the stakeholders to *understand* the visi=
on
statement *from the Central Aythority / MoUD.*

 b)       Provide a *forum for* *State =E2=80=93 Central =E2=80=93 Corpor=

 c)       *Address* the key *issues* and technical and infrastructural
*challenges* in identified areas* *of smart city and come up with *feasib=
le
recommendations* (technological and policy oriented) from the *experts*.

 d)       Understand and *identify the business opportunities* associated

Re: New Requirement for Ph.D. submission: Anti-plagiarism Software<BR>,"  Dear Colleagues

  I think we need to clarify one point, given this debate about a Ph.D.
thesis as an original piece of work. This statement is given in many
places, including in Cambridge where I did my thesis and is likely to hav=
e
come in our procedures as a carry over from the British educational
system.

  Despite this statement, in all universities, publications of Ph.D. work
during the progress of the work in science and engineering is the
accepted norm. More than that, it is considered highly desirable because
it ensures a high degree of peer review and validation. If five results
chapters correspond to five publications  have been assessed independentl=
y
by two referees each of a standard professional journal, it should only
serve to reinforce the validity of the work. If this is included in the
thesis, only two things need to be clearly ensured by the supervisor:

(a) All publications related to the thesis should be listed in the thesis=
,
preferably at the start.All standard scientific publishers e.g. American
Chemical Society, American Physical Society,  allow the work to be used
for a thesis. We can ensure that permission is taken through a web-based
Rightslink, without the hassle of having to write to editors.

(b) The supervisor should ensure that the student clearly states the
contribution made by him/her to the reported research. The degree of
separability of the work e.g. whether a particular section can be
attributed
to one individual may depend on the work. I think we should leave it to
the supervisor's professional judgement how these clarifications should b=
e
made- within chapters, in the abstract etc. A good examiner can easily
judge the accuracy, and in case of ambiguity, can request clarification i=
n
the report.

I think it is really unfortunate that we are creating a completely
unnecessary confusion about what is regarded as a marker of research
standardization and quality all over the world for Ph.D. research in the
sciences and engineering i.e. publications in peer-reviewed journals.
I would request the administration to please set this confusion to rest
publicly at the earliest.

Yours sincerely

Ph.D. theses, they typically just gather dust on library shelves. But

"My superannuation, Dr.JPS,Deputy Librarian at the age of 60 instead","Respected Prof. Shevgaonkarjee (Director Sir)

This is with respect to my superannuation at the age of 60 (Feb. 2015)
instead of 62 (which is my actual date of retirement i.e.Feb. 2017). I
would humbly like to submit the following:

1. I had written a letter to director sir on 25 Nov. 2014, which was
marked by DDO sir to Registrar, IIT Delhi on 27 Nov. 2014 with a note
""Please discuss"".

2. I have met Registrar Sir number of time and requested for follow up
action on my request. Till last week, i.e.16 Jan 2015, the letter was wit=
h
Registrar sir. I have not received any reply thereon.

3.  Director Sir, I have written in detail everything about my
superannuation in that letter.

4.  MHRD, Govt. of India as per VIth CPC has extended retirement age of 6=
2
years for Category of Librarians (i.e. Librarian, Deputy Librarian,
Assistant Librarian)

5.  Same MHRD orders are applied for UGC regulated University employees
and whole category of ALs,DLs and Librarians retire at the age of 62
years.

6.  I have appended a List of 30+ plus ALs,DLs and Librarians of BHU,Delh=
i
Univ., JNU and AMU with my request.

7.  Same MHRD orders for UGC was approved by our BOG and got implemented
for us.

8.  Our Category of Librarians (i.e.AL,DL,Librarian)have got academic
status as per Act and Statutes of IIT Delhi

9.  I am surprised to see that System Operators and Junior Programmers
with AGP Rs.6000 will retire at the age of 60 and a Deputy Librarian
(academic employee) with AGP Rs.9000 will retire at the age of 60. It's a
gross injustice with my career. System Programmers and Junior Programmers
have been equated with teachers pay scale by our BOG,inspite of no policy
and pay scale extended by MHRD.

10.  Two of my Deputy Librarians, Dr.(Mrs. Karuna Saha) and Dr.(Mrs.)
Kshama Puri have retired at the age of 62 years in the year 2002 and 2005
respectively.

11.  Category of Librarians is an academic employee by MHRD, otherwise
MHRD would have extended Grade Pay of Rs.5400,Rs.6600,Rs.7600 and Rs.8700
instead of AGP of Rs. 6000, Rs.7000,Rs.8000 and Rs.9000.

Retiring me two years early than my actual date of retirement ias going t=
o
leave a severe impact on my career:

12.  Retiring me 2 years early wil leave an impact on my pension benefits
as well as I will be deprived of my 2 years salary.

13. It will impact me Financially, mentally and physically.

14.  It is going to impact education of my two daughters, one in B.Tech.
Ist year and the other one in Class Xth standard.

14.  I will be deprived of my benefits and fixation as per VIth CPC of
Govt. of India

Keeping in view the foregoing facts, it is my humble request to all the
hon'ble dignitaries to please look into the matter and resolve this
anomaly at the earliest.

Hoping for a favourable action

Subject: regarding joining date as Assistant Professor
Date: 31.03.2015 13:21

Dear Sir,

As I have told you before, I have applied for prestigious Lise-Meitner
and Newton Fellowships with IFT Vienna Institute of Technology and
Imperial College London as my hosts respectively. The projects has been
written over several months with world leading researchers who have seen
a lot of promise in my recent works, and we believe that our
collaboration can really open new directions in high energy physics and
can also have a big broad impact in other areas of physics. It can not
only lead to eventually a derivation of the nuclear force from first
principles, but it can also open new directions in areas like high
temperature superconductivity, etc.

Undertaking these Fellowships will also give me success in future
international grant proposals.

I will come to know about the results for these Fellowships in June this
year.

If successful, I will like to work on a collaboration for six months in
Vienna or London. Once it is kickstarted, the collaboration can be
continued from IIT-D. However in our field it is very difficult to start
a collaboration without direct interaction in front of a blackboard, as
you very well know.

I strongly believe IIT-D can benefit a lot from these collaborations
with these world-leading research groups.

In case I get funded for these Fellowships, April 1, 2016 will be a good
joining date so I can work 6 months in Vienna or London. If I do not get
these Fellowships, I can join IIT-D on Oct 1, 2015.

So, I have two possibilities

(i) I wait till June. When the results for these Fellowships are
declared, I can communicate the final joining date to you officially,
whether it is Oct 1, 2015 or April 1, 2016. CAN I COMMUNICATE MY JOINING
DATE IN JUNE? WILL APRIL 1, 2016 BE ACCEPTABLE AS A JOINING DATE FOR
REASONS PROVIDED?

(ii) I join IIT-D on Oct 1, 2015 anyway and then go to Vienna/London by
taking an ""exceptional leave"". CAN I TAKE AN EXCEPTIONAL LEAVE
ALTERNATIVELY AFTER JOINING IIT-D ON OCTOBER 1, 2015?

Can you please tell me which of these possibilities could be better?

Best regards,
Ayan

Re: Publication Records: [Update: Stronger Criteria for Assoc Prof,"I too love this baby analogy !
Thanks Dr. Anima !

I need help now....
*How do we evaluate the performance of the mother:*

a) Count babies (Frequency, Cumulative Frequency)
b) Weigh babies (Citations, Patents,... )
c) Test the abilities ( Products?, Usefulness to society, Debates and
Discussions ?...)
d) Test Capabilities ( New directions, Foundations, Broad and Sustainable
Networks of understanding, ...)


*And what about inclusion of miscarriages in evaluation process due to :*

a) War related crisis (Bombings in academic neighborhoods,...)
b) Witchcraft (Strategies to jeopardize basic human and material resources
 for sake of fun by 'experienced craftsmen')
c) Improper nutrition (lack of culture of debate, discussion with research
focus n community)

Also I have queries on, whether we should also look at the *'environment'
vs. 'performance'* to rate the 'performance' in its correct perspective.
Will looking at the environment lead to 'reservation' for 'deprived' in the
society of unequals in research community? Should be leave to the 'fate' of
the individual to inherit the situations and argue for faith in 'Karma' as
the only way to clean up the mess in one's research life and continue to
struggle without acknowledgement?

Thanks in advance for your help in clearing my doubts.

Dear Prof. Panda,

In the yesterday's(22-01-2014) PC meeting, in the shortlisting criteria
for Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and  Professor positions I
did not agree for:

The total number of journal publications and the number of reputed journal
publications; also the reputed journal meaning/definition that you
mentioned.

However, I agreed for the rest of the points in the shortlisting criteria.
I never declined to sign on shortlisting criteria with the above mentioned
note. I must sign on the shortlisting criteria.

Also make sure that conference publication means referred international
conference publications.

Best regards,
SCS Rao.

Sub:-	Online Self Appraisal for the year 2013-14


The last date for submitting the online self appraisal for the year
2013-2014 was 31st July, 2014.  Substantial number of faculty members 
have
already submitted their performance appraisal reports online.  However,
some  faculty members were not able to complete the process.   In view 
of
the above, the last date for submission of online self appraisal for the
year 2013-14  is extended upto 30th September, 2014.

  In order to ensure availability of data in a digital  form,  the Online
Self Appraisal  System for the years 2011-12 and 2012-2013 can also be
accessed and filled till 30th September 2014,  in case not already
submitted.

The Online Self Appraisal System for the year 2014-15 is also live.  You
can login and add/edit/save the data related to conference / publication 
/
award etc. any time throughout the year.  This would also help you to
organize your personal records more efficiently for submission at an
appropriate time.

Instead I had submitted a hardcopy to the our HOD.
